# Data Analysis Visualization

In the dataset sheet, I added a new column called count and filled it up with 1s so as to have easy counts for each customer. This will make it much easier to calculate the churn rate in the pivot table.

Next, I created a pivot table in a new sheet. Then inserted a calculated field called churn rate that is churn/count.
